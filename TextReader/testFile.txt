Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both And sorry I could not travel both And sorry I could not travel both And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood And be one traveler, long I stood And be one traveler, long I stood And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could And looked down one as far as I could And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth. To where it bent in the undergrowth. To where it bent in the undergrowth. To where it bent in the undergrowth.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
